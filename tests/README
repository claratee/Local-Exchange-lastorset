Local Exchange test suite
=========================

Installing PHPUnit
------------------

    pear config-set auto_discover 1
    pear install pear.phpunit.de/PHPUnit
    pear install phpunit/DBUnit

In MySQL, create a database named `lex_test`:

    CREATE DATABASE lex_test CHARSET utf8;

Grant access to a user with username and password also set to `lex_test`:

    GRANT ALL ON lex_test.* TO 'lex_test'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'lex_test';

and run `php tests/create_test_db.php` from the project root. It's normal that it complains about missing tables, and there are
currently some deprecation warnings.

Then run the testsuite with PHPUnit from the project root using these command-line options:

    phpunit --bootstrap tests/bootstrap.php

Warning: Be careful when writing tests that have side effects, such as sending
e-mail.
